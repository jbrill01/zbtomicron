            <h1>A Powerhouse of Excellence</h1>
            <h4>The Omicon Chapter of Zeta Beta Tau was founded in 1987 at Tufts University. In the small room of 102 Hill Hall, our first four founders met to plan out the future of the chapter. Since that point, ZBT Omicron has enjoyed over 25 years of great memories, philanthropic efforts and social events at Tufts University.</h4></br>
            <h4>Since its founding, ZBT Omicron has seen success, a success that has continued over the past few years. We have fundraised tens of thousands of dollars for the Boston Children's Hospital, received national awards and accolades like Most Improved ZBT Chapter, and maintain our commitment to being Tufts' only non-pledging fraternity.</h4></br>
            <h4>We, the members of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity, believe that the development of the individual as a responsible, mature member of society is the primary goal of the university today. We believe that fraternity offers to the university community a unique, desirable and successful means of achieving this goal. In fulfilling the purposes of fraternity, we dedicate ourselves to the principles of Intellectual Awareness, Social Responsibility, Integrity, and Brotherly Love.</h4>
